"""Swing detection, checked against series worked out by hand.

The weight here is the *timing*, not just the arithmetic. A pivot is trivial to spot in
hindsight; the whole point is that the engine may only know it `strength` bars late, and the
`Swing` it returns must be stamped with the bar it happened on, not the bar it was found on. The
goldens pin exactly which update confirms which swing, so a change that let a swing surface early
— the anti-lookahead bug — fails loudly.
